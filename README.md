# fang-react

## How to build and run the project

* run `npm install` for dependencies
* create data/db folder under project root
* run `sh start-db.sh` to start mongodb
* `cd` to the project root in terminal, run `npm run watch`
* open another terminal window/tab, `cd` to the project root and run `gulp`
* run `sh import-suburb.sh` to import suburb table, you may need to change the database name in the shell script
* run `sh import-property.sh` to import testing properties

## Mongodb command tips

* run `mongo` to get into the mongodb command shell
* run `use nef` to select database 'nef'
* run `db.getCollectionNames()` to list all collections in the database
* run `db.property.find()` to list all data in collection 'property'
* run `db.property.drop()` to delete the collection 'property'

## Branching strategy

* please create a branch for each feature, branch name should be `feature\<BRANCH NAME>` or `bugbix\<BRANCH NAME>`
* use pull request to merge back to the master branch
* master branch for deployment
* tag the production version

## Project structure

* PropertyActions -> PropertyStore (handle all CRUD actions and states for property/properties)
* ListingActions -> ListingStore (handle all properties listing actions and states)
* SearchActions -> SearchStore (handle all search including search narrow downs)

## Testing
* install jest: npm install -g jest-cli
* run tests: npm test

## How to translate

1) do the following import in component if needed:
  ```
  import counterpart from 'counterpart'
  import Translate from 'react-translate-component'
  ```
2) put the translated string in JSON format under `locales` folder 
  a) for React component, use:
  ```
  <Translate content="nav.toggle" />
  ```
  b) for String output, use:
  ```
  counterpart("nav.search.placeholder")
  ```
for more details, please refer to [React Translate Componenent](https://github.com/martinandert/react-translate-component) and [Counterpart](https://github.com/martinandert/counterpart)

## Plan:

### stage 1
* ~~pagination (may use this one: [react-paginate](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate))~~
* ~~suburb/postcode search auto-complete~~
* ~~google map integration for property details page~~
* ~~translation (Using [React Translate Componenent](https://github.com/martinandert/react-translate-component), later on can move to [React-Intl V2](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/issues/162))~~
* ~~narrow down search results by price and property/room type~~
* ~~add property with image upload (may use this one: [react-dropzone](https://github.com/okonet/react-dropzone))~~
* ~~display property images carousel in property details page (may use this one: [react-responsive-carousel](https://github.com/leandrowd/react-responsive-carousel))~~
* ~~style polish & responsive~~

### stage 2
* user register/login
